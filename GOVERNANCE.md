# Governance Model

## Core Principles
- The project remains licensed under GPLv3 (or later).
- No relicensing without full community supermajority (e.g., 80% vote).
- No copyright assignment to private entities.
- Transparency in decision-making.

## Maintainers
Maintainers are contributors with sustained technical involvement.
Responsibilities:
- Review pull requests
- Ensure license compliance
- Protect project direction
Maintainers may be removed by community vote.

## Decision Process
- Minor changes → Maintainer approval
- Major changes → Public discussion + majority vote (75%)
- License changes → Supermajority required (80%)
